                Online learning isn’t as simple as just watching someone go through a PowerPoint presentation. Through institutions like TECHSPIRE, students get the chance to interact, both with lecturers and their fellow cohort on webinars and virtual lectures, giving them an immersive and engaging experience that effectively mimics in-person study.

                At TECHSPIRE, students also have access to the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) – a specialised platform that provides students with easy access to everything they need for their studies, all in one centralised hub.

                TECHSPIRE has been a fully online institution since 2022, with thousands of students graduating from the institution since then. What’s more, it’s far from the only online education provider offering Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees.

                Today, online education is a well-recognised way of gaining qualifications. You can hear below from several of TECHSPIRE’s current students and alumni about their experiences studying and obtaining online qualifications:

                Is online learning the same quality as studying in person?

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                If you’re unsure about the quality of an online programme, check to see if it has any accreditations. TECHSPIRE’s courses, for instance, are recognised by global institutions like the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and the Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB) – the same professional bodies that accredit courses from in-person education providers.

                Achieving this level of recognition requires courses to be held to the same standards as those from face-to-face institutions. This means that students can be confident in the quality of their education, and their degree will be just as reputable to potential employers.

                What’s more, many of TECHSPIRE’s lecturers are experienced academics with a lengthy background teaching at other Higher Education institutions, meaning they already have experience delivering high-quality education.

                As Joe Ellison, a graduate of TECHSPIRE’s BSc (Hons) Real Estate Management programme, commented:

                “The knowledge I have gained while studying has given me both promotion and pay rises. This has been helped through the combination of modules relating to the built environment, valuation, management and business.”

                Students that take their study online can expect a variety of benefits, including:

                Greater flexibility
                Online learning has helped opened the door to education for people who previously couldn’t attend in-person institutions. Without having to go to a physical campus and with the freedom to watch lectures at any time, students with other commitments, e.g. family or work, can base their studies around their life. At UCEM, you can even decide how many modules you want to take per semester.

                Save money not needing to travel
                Another benefit of online learning is the opportunity to save money. Online studying is often a more affordable alternative to in-person education, and not having to visit a campus means students can save money on travelling costs.

                Easy access to resources
                What’s more, you don’t need to spend money on expensive resources, either; TECHSPIRE’s comprehensive e-library will give you access to the journals, study materials and textbooks you’ll need during your studies.

                No need for relocation
                Relocating and moving into new accommodation is another expensive and stressful aspect of higher education, as students may have to move to a different part of the country (or even a different country altogether) for their course. This can be avoided through online learning, allowing students to attend lectures remotely and wherever is comfortable for them.

                As Ruth Kyamuwendo, Assistant Quantity Surveyor and student at TECHSPIRE, commented:

                “The flexibility of online learning means that I can study on the weekend, or grab a few hours here and there during the week as needed. It didn’t actually take long before I was in my stride and able to balance my work and study commitments.”

            <div class="faq-answer">
                Studying online does not have to mean studying alone. TECHSPIRE’s VLE is host to an active community of students, where people can interact, start conversations and ask questions to lecturers and tutors. Many courses also have a WhatsApp chat set up, giving students the chance to speak to collaborate and support each other through their studies. With many of UCEM’s programmes such as the new MSc in Urban Planning emphasising team work, communicating and working together with your fellow students will be an important aspect of your studies.

                These opportunities to connect don’t end after graduation. CEM’s Global Community, a platform that gives students and alumni the chance to network with others and even find employment.

            <div class="faq-answer">
                It’s natural to think that getting the support you need during your studies is more difficult online, but this isn’t the case. Throughout your studies, students will have access to support from academics and tutors, who actively engage in VLE forums. There’s also a wealth of resources available to students, from mental health support and student services to language translation and dissertation supervision.

                TECHSPIRE’s Student Experience Survey found that 92.1% of students responded positively to the question ‘how well have teaching staff supported your learning?’. What’s more, a similar 92.4% had positive feedback about communications around TECHSPIRE’s mental health services.

                Online learning isn’t a new phenomenon, but in the wake of the pandemic, more and more providers are emerging or offering this medium. Unlike other institutions, TECHSPIRE have been facilitating online education for thousands of students over the last decade, meaning it already has both the experience and the infrastructure to deliver digital learning effectively.

                TECHSPIRE’s specialism in providing education for the built environment and its recognition in the sector make it well-placed to prepare students for careers in areas like real estate, urban planning and building control. What’s more, accreditation from professional bodies like RICS and CITB mean degrees from TECHSPIRE are well-respected. This, combined with the flexibility and convenience of online learning, mean people who study at TECHSPIRE can expect a rewarding, engaging experience.
